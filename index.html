          <p>Why not choose something more safe, with job security and a clearly marked road. For me, my answers seemed
            to want chaotic, dangerous, and unstable (in a good way?). My answers changed every few years from
            1981-2015, every response more different than the next.</p>

          <p>Throughout my life I have been fearless about diving head first into professions I had little experience
            and/or little knowledge about. My motto was I could fake it till I make it. I thought I would learn with
            onsite training and experience coupled with self discipline. In some instances that was true, not so much
            for others but that is a topic for another post. My Resume if I were to write it all out is all over the map
            without any <em>apparent</em> concentration in one area. I was a:</p>

          <p>At this point you must think I’m either 100 years old, Don Quixote’s female counter part, crazy or a
            grifter. I’d like to think I’m a <em>healthy</em> combination of the last two. So to make a long story
            longer, after spending a lifetime working in different professions, I finally took the plunge to pursue my
            true passion, are you ready … Programming/computer science/developer (call it what you want) the field is
            TECHNOLOGY! In October 2015 I quit my job and enrolled in <a href="https://www.bloc.io/"
              target="_blank">Bloc.io</a> software engineering track.</p>

          <p>I stated above that I finally found my calling in programming, and I know it sounds like just another dot
            in my lists of professions soon to be followed by another in the minds of you skeptics BUT! I say Nay! There
            is one profession all encompassing that touches every single profession in the world. Technology and
            Computers! No matter where you work or in what you work, programming is right there doing something. With a
            strong foundation in programming and software engineering I could use all the skills I have amassed during
            my professional journey and put them to use. I have also strengthened these skills with the <a
              href="https://bootcamp.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Rutgers Bootcamp</a> for Full-Stack Engineering. </p>

          <p>It was clear I was destined to be in the world of technology. As a programmer or software developer I can
            work in any all professional worlds. I can build apps that use virtual reality to treat patients with Panic
            Attacks or Generalized Anxiety Disorders. I can develop technology that attaches to a pool cue and adjusts
            your stroke while teaching you how adjusting your speed and where you hit the cueball will affect the object
            ball. I can create interactive and professional sites for bands/artists that go viral and design electronic
            press kits that attract major labels. I can collaborate with financial institutions to develop securities
            software and evaluate how much money someone may need in retirement. I can create electronic medical records
            and evaluation templates that become industry standards in psychiatric facilities. The possibilities in each
            profession I have worked in are endless with programming. That is how I know, this perpetual professional
            has found her final profession. A profession that opens the enitre world to me and any where I want to go.
          </p>

          <p>I would like to end on a very important note, I don’t care if you’re 5 or 105 Never give up on chasing and
            doing what you love. The journey you take will lead you to what you really want to do, trust your gut. There
            is nothing in the world like waking up and loving your job, never give up on being able to do something you
            love.</p>

          <p>Each one of my professions has lead me to discover and help me to develop my passion for computers and
            programming. with each job there was a spark that grew into a roaring fire inside of me! A curiosity and
            insatiable thirst for wanting to be able to do, develop and create anything I desired through applications,
            software and websites that touched on all my professions from the past and soon my future.</p>
